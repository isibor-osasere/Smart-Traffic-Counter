    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Monitoring and managing vehicle flow in real-time is critical for optimizing traffic management, ensuring road safety, and enhancing infrastructure planning. However, traditional methods rely on costly hardware installations (e.g., loop detectors, cameras with fixed thresholds), which can be inefficient and fail to adapt to dynamic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Application\n",
    "- **Smart Traffic Management System**:\n",
    "This vehicle counter project provides an AI-powered solution to count and classify vehicles (e.g., cars, buses, trucks) in real-time using video feeds. It can be deployed for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traffic Flow Analysis:** Monitor and analyze vehicle volume on highways or intersections to reduce congestion.\n",
    "- **Toll Booth Automation:** Count and classify vehicles for automated toll collection systems.\n",
    "- **Accident Detection:** Track abnormal vehicle behavior (e.g., sudden stops) for emergency alerts.\n",
    "- **Urban Planning:** Use traffic data to design better road networks and optimize signal timings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging AI-based detection and tracking, this system offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional traffic monitoring methods."
